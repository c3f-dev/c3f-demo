# c3f-demo
Welcome to our demo! This is a page for demonstrating practical covert communication between isolated browser instances via GPU rendering queue contention. 

In this work, we discoverd a novel covert channel due to GPU rendering queue contention and then design a framework, called C3F, for both cross-mode and cross-browser covert communication.

Please follow the instructions on the sender and receiver (i.e., the index) page, input the message you would like to transmit through the covert channel, and you will see the receiver successfully receives the message in this demo.
